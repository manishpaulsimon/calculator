# Calculator: Simple and Intuitive
Welcome to the GitHub repository for "Calculator," a project designed to showcase foundational web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator offers a minimalist yet robust interface that balances simplicity with functionality, making it a perfect tool for everyday arithmetic tasks.

## Features and Functionality
* **Interactive UI**: Utilizes button elements for user input, ensuring an interactive and responsive experience.
* **Support for Basic Operations**: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo directly through the UI.
* **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time display updates showing the current calculation to keep users informed of the operation in progress.
Advanced Features:
* **Negation**: Users can negate a number by pressing the Â± button, making it easy to switch between positive and negative values.
* **Decimal Operations**: The calculator handles decimal points, allowing for more precise calculations involving fractions.
* **Keyboard Support**: For power users, this calculator also supports keyboard inputs for numbers and operators, streamlining data entry and making it more accessible.
* **Error Handling**: It provides immediate feedback on illegal operations, preventing user confusion and ensuring a smoother user experience.
* **Visual Feedback for Button Presses**: Buttons visually respond to clicks, which helps users see which operation is being processed.

## Technical Overview
* **Event Listeners**: The calculator uses event listeners extensively to handle user interactions such as button clicks and keyboard events, updating the display and internal state accordingly.
* **State Management**:  Maintains state through variables representing current values, selected operator, and whether a result has been displayed. This ensures accurate calculations and seamless continuation of operations.
* **Responsive Design**: Adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and device orientations, ensuring it is as functional on a mobile phone as it is on a desktop.
